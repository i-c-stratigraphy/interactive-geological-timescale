### Production deployment from pre-built files
This repository contains a pre-built arechive file for deployment: [timescale.tar.gz](timescale.tar.gz).

You can rebuild this file by taring and gzipping the dist/ folder created with `npm run build`. Just make sure you make the following changes after building:

1. convert paths in index.html from =/ to just =
    * 9 instances
